## About the frontend application
1. I have used the repository pattern to improve the maintainablity of code in case of API updates
2. Infinite scroll has been implemented - the see more button. I would have liked to use Intersection Observer API if time permitted.
3. I would have liked to implement placeholders/skeletons while the API data is being retrieved.
